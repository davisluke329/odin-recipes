    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Potatoes:</strong>6-8 peeled and diced. The type of potatoes is your preferece. I prefer Idaho Potatoes or Russet Potatoes</li>
      <li><strong>Coarse Sea Salt:</strong>4 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Ground Black Pepper:</strong>2 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Sour Cream:</strong>1 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Milk:</strong>1/4 cup. You can use 2% or whole milk.</li>
      <li><strong>Butter</strong>1-1/2 sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Boil potatoes.</strong>Bring water to a boil and add the peeled and diced potatoes to the water. You shouldn't need more than 8 cups of water. Boil potatoes until they are soft. You can check the softness by taking a piece out and crushing it with a fork.</li>
      <li><strong>Mash potatoes.</strong>Once the potatoes are soft, drain the water and place the potatoes in a large wooden or plastic bowl. Using an electric mixer or a hand masher, start mashing the potatoes until they start to blend together and do not contain chunks.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the milk.</strong>Slowly add milk to the potatoes while you continue to mash them. This will start the fluff the potatoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the butter.</strong> Place a stick of butter in the bowl and continue to mash the potatoes until the butter has completely melted.</li>
      <li><strong>Add sour cream.</strong> Add the sour cream to the bowl and mix evenly.</li>
      <li><strong>Top with salt and pepper.</strong>Top with salt and pepper and your potatoes are ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
