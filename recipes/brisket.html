    <h3>This is how you eat a cow!</h3>
    <p>
      Learning how to smoke a brisket seems hard, but with the right tools and patience, you can make a meal that the whole family can enjoy.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brisket:</strong>You can purchase the brisket from your local butcher. Ensure that the brisket is at least a 1/2 lbs cut.</li>
      <li><strong>Coarse Sea Salt:</strong>2 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Ground Black Pepper:</strong>2 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Garlic Salt:</strong>1 tbsp</li>
      <li><strong>Mustard:</strong>1/4 cup</li>
      <li><strong>Meat Wrapping Paper</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Hardwood for Smoker:</strong>My personal preference is a hardwood like oak or cherry wood.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Trim your brisket.</strong>Spend 20-30 minutes trimming the excess fat off of the brisket. Do not worry about trimming all of the fat off, just the thick layer on the top of the brisket.</li>
      <li><strong>Season the brisket.</strong>Rub the mustard on the outside of the meat. Once this is finished, rub the coarse sea salt, ground black pepper, and garlic salt on the brisket. It is best to have these seasonings pre-mixed before rubbing them on your brisket</li>
      <li><strong>Smoke your brisket.</strong>Ignite the wood in the smoker and let it burn until a nice blue smoke is present in the smoker. Set the meat inside of the smoker once the temperature is at 225. Leave the brisket in the smoker for 6-8 hours chekcing the temperature as needed</li>
      <li><strong>Wrap your brisket.</strong> After 6-8 hours, take your brisket out of the smoker and wrap it in the wrapping paper. Wrap it just like you would a christmas gift and set the brisket back in the smoker. Leave the brisket until the internal temperature of the meat is 205&#8457. Make sure the meat thermometer is placed inside of the meat, not the fat.</li>
      <li><strong>Rest your brisket.</strong> Take your brisket out of the smoker and let it cool for at least an hour. This allows the juicy goodness inside of the meat to settle.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve your brisket.</strong> After your brisket is settled, it's time to share! Cut against the grain of the meat in thin slices and enjoy with your favorite barbecue sauce.</li>
    </ol>
